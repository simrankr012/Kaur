                    <p>“I don’t know what has happened to him” , Disha said with a low tone . It was just another day when Disha and her two close friends Aman and Karan were discussing about why arjun drifted away suddenly . ” I have already asked him so many times ” , “He doesn’t care anymore” , ” It’s his wish” … were some of the replies the other two gave. Everyday they tried to figure out the reason behind Arjun’s weird behaviour against the three of them . But none of them was able to . Days passed by , and soon they started engulfing the fact that their squad now  comprises of 3 and not 4 persons.While returning home ,Disha met with an accident on the last day of her final exams . Both Aman and Karan rushed to city hospital when her mother informed them about the fatal accident .”Disha had an accident today on her way back home. She might go into comma. She needs a blood donor asap . As her blood group is O negative so the donors are rare and the hospital doesn’t have much units left. She needs us . Reach city hospital asap “, Aman texted Arjun.</p>
<p>Aman kept on checking his phone waiting for Arjun to read the msg . 10 mins later the ticks on the message turned blue. 2 hours passed by but no reply came . “Don’t expect him to come , lets go back to the hospital” , karan said .
</p>
<p>They  went back to check on her . Doctors told them that she got a donor but the next 24 hours were critical. They asked the doctor about the donor so as to thank him . But the doctors told them that the donor has refused to disclose his identity and has already left as he was having a flight in few hours.
</p>
<p>2 days later ..
</p>
<p>Disha was saved from slipping into coma. After she was healthy enough, her parents took her home.
</p>
<p>College was already over , so they all started looking for jobs and executing their future plans .
</p>
<p>4 years later ..
</p>
 <p>All three of them were settled and disha was getting married .
</p>
<p>Sitting alone in her room , she started scrolling her gallery. Under the album “my squad” was their pictures. The four of them . There was a heavy feeling .
</p>
<p>“I AM GETTING MARRIED ON 24TH DECEMBER. HOPE TO SEE YOU AT THE WEDDING ” , disha texted from her new number.
</p>
<p>“WHOSE THIS? ” , the reply came .
</p>
<p>It was arjun’s number …
</p>
<p><i><b>“THE SAME GIRL WHOM YOU DONATED BLOOD 4 YEARS BACK AND SAVED HER LIFE SO THAT SHE COULD LIVE THIS DAY”, she replied.</b></i></p>
